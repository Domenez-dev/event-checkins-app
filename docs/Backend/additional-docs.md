### 1. **OAuth2 and Gmail API Integration - Documentation**

#### Purpose

This document outlines the steps to integrate OAuth2 for Gmail API to send emails containing QR codes and other event details to participants. It covers the OAuth2 flow, configuration of Gmail API, and security considerations.

#### Contents

1. **Overview**
    
    - The Gmail API is used to send emails from the backend to participants, containing QR codes for event check-ins. OAuth2 is utilized to securely authenticate and authorize the app to send emails on behalf of the user.
2. **OAuth2 Flow**
    
    - **Create Project on Google Cloud**: Start by creating a project on [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
        - Enable the **Gmail API**.
        - Create **OAuth 2.0 credentials** for your project (Client ID and Client Secret).
    - **Get Access Tokens**: The OAuth2 authentication flow involves obtaining access tokens that allow the app to interact with Gmail on behalf of the user. These tokens need to be refreshed periodically.
        - Implement OAuth2 flow using the **Google OAuth2 library** in your backend.
        - The tokens are stored securely in the server (preferably using environment variables or a secure store).
    - **OAuth Scopes**: Ensure the appropriate OAuth scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`) is granted during the OAuth process to allow sending emails.
3. **Gmail API Configuration**
    
    - **Set Up Gmail API in the Backend**:
        - Install the Google API client library:
            
            ```bash
            pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
            ```
            
        - Implement the logic to send emails using Gmail API by authenticating with the stored OAuth2 tokens.
        - Code example to send an email using Gmail API:
            
            ```python
            from googleapiclient.discovery import build
            from google_auth_oauthlib.flow import InstalledAppFlow
            
            SCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send']
            creds = None
            # Load or generate credentials
            
            service = build('gmail', 'v1', credentials=creds)
            message = create_message(sender, to, subject, body)
            send_message(service, "me", message)
            ```
            
4. **Security Considerations**
    
    - **Token Security**: Always ensure tokens are stored securely. They should not be exposed in any client-side code or logs.
    - **OAuth Token Expiry**: Implement refresh token logic to handle token expiration. This ensures the app remains authorized without needing user intervention.
5. **Troubleshooting**
    
    - **Token Errors**: Handle token expiration or invalid token errors by refreshing the token.
    - **Permission Errors**: Ensure that the OAuth2 consent screen is correctly configured and the right Gmail API permissions are granted.

### 2. **Testing and Quality Assurance (QA) Procedures - Documentation**

#### Purpose

This document provides the procedures for testing the backend system, ensuring the integrity, security, and functionality of the app. It outlines the different types of tests performed, tools used (including Postman), and testing strategies.

#### Contents

1. **Overview**
    
    - Quality assurance (QA) and testing ensure that the app performs correctly and securely. This document covers the process of unit testing, integration testing, security testing, and performance testing, with Postman used for API testing.
2. **Unit Testing**
    
    - **Unit Tests**: Unit tests are written to test individual components of the backend, ensuring that each part works as expected.
    - **Testing Framework**: Use `pytest` or Django’s built-in test framework to write unit tests for models, views, and utility functions.
    - Example of a unit test for participant creation:
        
        ```python
        from django.test import TestCase
        from .models import Participant
        
        class ParticipantTestCase(TestCase):
            def test_participant_creation(self):
                participant = Participant.objects.create(name="John Doe")
                self.assertEqual(participant.name, "John Doe")
        ```
        
3. **Integration Testing**
    
    - **API Endpoints Testing**: Integration tests ensure that the system's components interact correctly. Postman is used to test API endpoints for creating events, sending emails, and processing QR codes.
    - **Postman Collection**: Create a collection of API endpoints in Postman. Share collections to allow easy collaboration with the frontend team.
        - Test **GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, and **DELETE** requests to ensure each API behaves as expected.
    - Example Postman Test:
        
        ```json
        {
          "info": {
            "name": "Event Check-in API",
            "schema": "..."
          },
          "item": [
            {
              "name": "Create Participant",
              "request": {
                "method": "POST",
                "url": "https://yourapp.com/api/participants/",
                "body": {
                  "mode": "raw",
                  "raw": "{\"name\":\"John Doe\"}"
                }
              },
              "response": [
                {
                  "status": "200 OK",
                  "body": "{\"id\": 1, \"name\": \"John Doe\"}"
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
        
4. **Performance Testing**
    
    - **Load Testing**: Use tools like `Locust` or `Apache JMeter` to simulate a high volume of requests and ensure the backend can handle large traffic.
    - **Scalability**: Test how the app behaves when the number of events or participants increases. Ensure that the database and server resources scale effectively.
5. **Security Testing**
    
    - **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use tools like `OWASP ZAP` or `Burp Suite` to scan for vulnerabilities in the backend system.
    - **Authentication Testing**: Ensure that session management and token handling are secure and protected from common attacks like CSRF and XSS.
    - **Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks to find potential weak points in the system.
6. **Regression Testing**
    
    - Ensure that new features or bug fixes do not break existing functionality. Run your test suite after each update to verify that all components still work as expected.
